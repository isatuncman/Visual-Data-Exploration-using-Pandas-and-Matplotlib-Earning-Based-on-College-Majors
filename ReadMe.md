# Data Analysis with Python Project
## Visual Analysis of Earnings Based on Majors using Pandas and Matplotlib

### Objective:
  The aim of this project is to explore the majors, earnings and the factors which may impact the earnings in the dataset using visual plots.

### Dataset:
  The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo. The dataset consists of 21 columns and 173 rows. Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.

### Analyses
  * The dataset is explored using python pandas. I answered below questions using  various bar plots, scatter plots, histograms and scatter matrices.:
    - Do students in more popular majors make more money?
    - How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
    - Which category of majors have the most students?
